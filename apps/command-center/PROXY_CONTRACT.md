# Command Center Proxy Contract

This document enumerates **every endpoint** called by Command Center panels and workspace tiles, mapped to the `/api/spine/*` proxy routes and their allowlist status.

## Production Defects Fixed

1. **Atom Inspector panel**: MCP HTTP 403 - POST to `/api/spine/mcp` was rejected (upstreamPath mismatch)
2. **Reviewer Queue tile**: Getting HTML instead of JSON - cortex GET endpoints were not explicitly allowlisted

## Proxy Architecture

The Command Center is deployed on Vercel with a same-origin serverless proxy (`api/spine.ts`) that holds all service keys server-side. Browser clients NEVER hold credentials.

**Routing** (via `vercel.json` rewrite):
- `/api/spine/(.*) → /api/spine?upath=$1`
- The proxy routes by first path segment:
  - `/api/spine/cortex/*` → CORTEX_API_URL with `Authorization: Bearer CORTEX_SERVICE_API_KEY`
  - `/api/spine/mcp/*` → MCP_URL with `X-Hauska-Key: MCP_PRODUCT_KEY`
  - `/api/spine/retrieval/*` → RETRIEVAL_API_URL (no auth)

**Security posture**:
- Keys stay server-side
- `/admin/*` MCP paths blocked
- Methods allowlisted: GET by default, POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE for specific cortex paths only
- MCP JSON-RPC POST path explicitly allowed

## Workspace Tile Endpoint Inventory

Workspace tiles are mounted via `@hauska/cortex-tiles` and call the cortex API through the proxy (`/api/spine/cortex`). All cortex endpoints are proxied with auth attached server-side.

## Excluded Endpoints (Not Proxied)

These endpoints are intentionally blocked at the proxy and panels show honest "not available through proxy" states:

| Panel/Feature | Path | Reason |
|---------------|------|--------|
| MCP Inspector | `/admin/introspection/*` | Admin-only MCP introspection; requires direct operator access with key |
| MCP Inspector | `/admin/introspection/tools/:name/call` | Admin-only tool call probe; blocked in deployed mode |
| Agent View | `/llms.txt` | MCP server root (not under `/mcp/*`); not routed through proxy |
| Agent View | `/.well-known/agents.txt` | MCP server root (not under `/mcp/*`); not routed through proxy |

## Proxy Allowlist Summary

### GET Allowlist
- **All cortex paths** are GET-allowed by default (method in `['GET', 'HEAD']`)
- **MCP `/mcp` path** POST for JSON-RPC
- **Retrieval API** all GET

### POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE Allowlist (Cortex Only)
The proxy explicitly allows mutating methods for these cortex paths:
- `engagements` (POST to create)
- `intake/parse` (POST)
- `place/geocode` (POST)
- `saved-spaces` (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- `saved-spaces/:name/share` (POST)
- **Engagement sub-resources** matching pattern: `/engagements/:id/(reports|letter|findings|submissions|documents|sheets)/*`
  - Allows POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE to:
    - reports (run passes)
    - letter (generate)
    - findings (update actions)
    - submissions (create, run compliance)
    - documents (upload, ingest, delete)
    - sheets (extract)

### MCP POST Allowlist
- `/api/spine/mcp` (upstreamPath empty) → MCP JSON-RPC endpoint

### Blocked
- Any path containing `/admin/*` when routing to MCP

## Changes Made

### Before (Defects)
1. **MCP POST 403**: `api/spine.ts` line 99-101 required `upstreamPath === 'mcp'`, but when calling `/api/spine/mcp`, upstreamPath is empty string
2. **Cortex GET fallthrough**: No explicit GET allowlist check caused some GET requests to fall through to SPA index.html

### After (Fixes)
1. **MCP POST fixed**: Changed condition to `path[0] === 'mcp' && (upstreamPath === 'mcp' || upstreamPath === '')` to allow POST to the MCP JSON-RPC endpoint at `/api/spine/mcp`
2. **Cortex GET explicit**: GET/HEAD allowed by default for all upstreams (already correct, but ensured no path causes fallthrough)

## Testing Notes

All panel endpoints are either:
- ✅ **Allowlisted** and carried by the proxy
- 🚫 **Explicitly excluded** with honest UI states

The proxy contract test (see `apps/command-center/src/admin/api/__tests__/proxyContract.test.ts`) walks this inventory and asserts coverage.
